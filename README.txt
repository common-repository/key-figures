Display key figures with custom styles and animations in visual editor.

== Description ==

**Main features**

This plugin is used to generate blocks of key figures in your content.

Fully customizable, it allows many settings:

*	dimensions of each element
*	text sizes and alignment
*	positioning
*	animations (like counter or fade in)
*	background and text colors
*	borders
*	margins and paddings

And on the plugin settings page, you can preview the front-end rendering :)

It does *not* use any shortcode, so you do *not* need any technical skills to use it and it doesn’t broke your website if you decide to remove the plugin later.

The plugin simply add a new button to your visual editor to create key figure boxes in your content.
